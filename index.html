                <h2>Welcome to TBD!</h2>
                <p>Blockchain technology is revolutionizing the way we think about data and transactions. Explore the basics and understand the potential of blockchain technology in various industries.</p>

                <h2>What is Blockchain?</h2>
                <p>Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records the provenance of a digital asset. By design, the data on a blockchain cannot be modified, which makes it a legitimate disruptor for industries like payments, cybersecurity, and healthcare.</p>
                <h2>What are NFTs?</h2>
                <p>NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are a type of digital asset that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a unique item or piece of content, typically using blockchain technology. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible (meaning each coin or token is identical and can be exchanged one-for-one), NFTs are unique and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis.</p>
                <h2>What is DeFi?</h2>
                <p>DeFi, short for Decentralized Finance, refers to a system of financial applications and services built on blockchain technology, specifically on decentralized networks like Ethereum. Unlike traditional financial systems, which rely on central institutions like banks, DeFi operates without intermediaries, allowing users to engage in financial activities directly through smart contractsâ€”self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.</p>
                <h2>What is Ethereum?</h2>
                <p>Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Unlike Bitcoin, which is primarily focused on being a digital currency, Ethereum is designed to be a versatile platform for various decentralized applications and services.
